# 📊 Analytics Dashboard - Separate Page Implementation

## ✅ What Was Done

The Analytics Dashboard has been moved to a **separate page** (`analytics.html`) instead of being on the same page as the main analyzer.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **1. User Flow**

1. **Analyze Resumes** on the main page (`index.html`)
2. **Click "View Analytics Dashboard"** button in Results section
3. **Navigate to analytics page** (`analytics.html`) in same tab
4. **View comprehensive analytics** with tables and charts

### **2. Data Flow**

```
Main Page (index.html)
    ↓
Analyze Resumes
    ↓
Save data to localStorage
    ↓
Click "View Analytics Dashboard"
    ↓
Navigate to analytics.html (same tab)
    ↓
Load data from localStorage
    ↓
Display analytics dashboard
```
